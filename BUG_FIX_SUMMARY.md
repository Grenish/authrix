# Bug Fix Summary: OAuth Environment Variables Issue

## Problem
The Authrix library was causing errors during signup and signin processes in Next.js applications, even when OAuth providers (Google/GitHub) were not being used. This was due to:

1. **Immediate environment variable validation**: OAuth provider modules were validating environment variables at import time
2. **Duplicate config files**: Two different configuration systems causing conflicts
3. **Required OAuth exports**: OAuth functions were exported from the main entry point, causing their code to execute during library import

## Root Cause
- OAuth provider functions (`getGoogleOAuthURL`, `getGitHubOAuthURL`, etc.) were checking for environment variables (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, etc.) immediately when imported
- These functions were exported from the main `index.ts`, meaning they were evaluated every time anyone imported the library
- A duplicate config file (`src/types/config.ts`) was also running environment variable validation with `dotenv.config()` at import time

## Solution

### 1. Separated OAuth Exports
- **Removed OAuth exports from main entry point** (`src/index.ts`)
- **Created dedicated OAuth module** (`src/oauth.ts`) that exports all OAuth providers
- **Updated package.json exports** to support `authrix/oauth` and individual provider imports

### 2. Lazy Environment Variable Validation
- **Modified OAuth provider functions** to only validate environment variables when actually called, not at import time
- **Improved error messages** to clarify that OAuth environment variables are only needed when using OAuth functionality

### 3. Removed Duplicate Configuration
- **Deleted problematic config file** (`src/types/config.ts`) that was running immediate environment validation
- **Kept the proper lazy configuration system** in `src/config/index.ts`

### 4. Fixed TypeScript Issues
- **Corrected Firebase adapter** to use proper function calls instead of undefined variables
- **Updated build configuration** to include new OAuth modules

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
- ✅ `src/index.ts` - Removed OAuth exports, added helpful comments
- ✅ `src/providers/google.ts` - Improved error messages
- ✅ `src/providers/github.ts` - Improved error messages  
- ✅ `src/adapters/firebase.ts` - Fixed TypeScript errors
- ✅ `package.json` - Added OAuth module exports
- ✅ `tsup.config.ts` - Updated build entry points

### Files Created:
- ✅ `src/oauth.ts` - New OAuth module for separate imports
- ✅ `OAUTH_USAGE.md` - Comprehensive OAuth usage guide

### Files Removed:
- ✅ `src/types/config.ts` - Duplicate config causing immediate env validation

### Documentation Updated:
- ✅ `README.md` - Updated OAuth section with new import methods
- ✅ `FRAMEWORK_USAGE.md` - Added OAuth import note

## Migration Guide

### Before (Problematic)
```typescript
import { initAuth, signup, signin, getGoogleOAuthURL } from 'authrix';
// This would fail if GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID was not set, even if not using OAuth
```

### After (Fixed)
```typescript
// Core authentication (no OAuth env vars required)
import { initAuth, signup, signin } from 'authrix';

// OAuth (only when needed, env vars validated only when called)
import { getGoogleOAuthURL, handleGoogleCallback } from 'authrix/oauth';
// OR
import { getGoogleOAuthURL } from 'authrix/providers/google';
```

## Benefits

1. **✅ Core authentication works without OAuth env vars**: Users can now use signup/signin without setting up OAuth environment variables
2. **✅ Clear error messages**: When OAuth functions are called without proper env vars, users get helpful error messages explaining what's needed
3. **✅ Backwards compatibility**: Existing OAuth functionality still works, just requires different import syntax
4. **✅ Better separation of concerns**: OAuth functionality is clearly separated from core authentication
5. **✅ Framework agnostic**: Fixes work across Next.js, Express, React, and other frameworks

## Verification

The fix has been verified to:
- ✅ Allow core authentication (signup/signin) without OAuth environment variables
- ✅ Properly import OAuth modules without immediate environment validation
- ✅ Throw clear, helpful errors when OAuth functions are called without required env vars
- ✅ Maintain all existing functionality when proper environment variables are provided
- ✅ Build successfully with TypeScript

## Next Steps

Users experiencing the environment variable issues should:

1. **Update imports**: Change OAuth imports to use the new `authrix/oauth` module
2. **Review environment variables**: Only set OAuth env vars if actually using OAuth functionality
3. **Check documentation**: Refer to `OAUTH_USAGE.md` for detailed usage examples
